This directory contains an example of a `pyproject.toml` project, useful with PyDeploy, that consists of an application that uses `numpy`. Invoke it with the command line `np_example`.

Note that a project that uses `numpy` will have approximately 43 MB (on Microsoft Windows) added to the size of the resulting artifact.
